"Ole: ""I had the best manager as a player. [Sir Alex] influenced me in everything - ever since my injury in 2003, I've been making the notes, what he did in certain situations and I've already been in touch with him, because there's no-one better to get advice from."" #MUFC"
"""The first game is about giving my principles to the boys, getting them to understand how I want them to play, how we want to play as a team,"" Ole says. ""Then we'll start looking at results and seeing how many points we can gather."" #MUFC"
"""Michael [Carrick] and Kieran [McKenna] have been great,"" says Ole. ""It's great being back home and seeing the development already. There's so many games in the next 10-15 days, and it's about picking up results."" #MUFC"
"""The players are happy - there's a good mood,"" Ole says. ""Every time you meet new people you're excited. It's my first time meeting a few of them, but there's a few I knew before. They've all been great."" #MUFC"
"Ole: ""I didn't think twice when [United] called to sign me as a player. Obviously this is more of an honour, and I feel privileged to be helping the club for a few months."" #MUFC"

"""I spoke with Carlos last night,"" Jose says. ""He said I was the king of coaches, not the king of football, for my winning periods with Porto, and because when I left Portugal, I opened the door for more Portuguese coaches to leave. I thanked him for his nice words."" #MUFC"
"""Swansea are dangerous on the counter-attack,"" the boss adds. ""They are powerful from set-pieces, using the aerial ability of their three centre-backs. And from a mental point of view, you can feel the fantastic work by Carlos, the team looks happy and confident."" #MUFC"
"Jose on Swansea: ""Since Carlos [Carvalhal] arrived it's obvious the team has improved a lot, they have got points that many wouldn't expect them to have got. So, we will face a team that are very well organised, especially from a defensive point of view."" #MUFC pic.twitter.com/LeicI4mvWH"
"Jose on @Ibra_Official: ""He's a huge player that European football is losing. But this period with LA Galaxy will be very good for him, he will be good for American football, because of what he can do; his personality, his passion and his professionalism"" #MUFC pic.twitter.com/DxrJqfuCfg"

"Jose on @RomeluLukaku9: ""He's an important guy for me, he's one of the guys that I trust - I love his attitude and character. It's not just about the goals he scores, but what he brings to the team and he brings to the team exactly that, his spirit."" #MUFC pic.twitter.com/iKKAXj0Ol1"
"The boss on #MUFC's fans: ""They help us. At Crystal Palace, you would imagine, if you are losing 2-0, our away fans would disapprove or criticise, but we only felt support from all of them."""
"Jose: ""We have three matches now: Liverpool, Sevilla and Brighton. If you asked me to choose the most important one - I can't choose. The fans wouldn't be happy if I say that Liverpool is the biggest match of the season and then Sevilla or Brighton is not a big match. "" #MUFC"
"More on #MUFC v Liverpool: ""Of course I want to win,"" says the boss. ""It's a big match, a big opponent. It's the team that's just behind us. It's a team that is already in the Champions League last eight. But, I'm not very good on rivalries, every opponent is a rival for me."""

"“I’m really happy to be involved in this tie,” Valencia says. “Seville is a marvellous city and we are absolutely concentrated on tomorrow’s match. I think that we will do a really good job and our fans will leave here really happy."" #MUFC"
".@Anto_V25 on @Alexis_Sanchez: ""We know that Alexis is a very good player. He is already proving how good he is for us, but we also have 10 other very good players, and we are working well together."" #MUFC"
"""I've seen some matches of Sevilla, and we are worried about some of their players,"" Valencia says. ""But we are confident if we can stay concentrated, we can come away with a great result. We are really strong and we are ready for our match tomorrow night."" #MUFC"
That's all from the boss - @Anto_V25 is next up to face the media... #MUFC
"Jose: “[Sevilla] can be nice to us and say we are favourites. But I prefer to say they have a good mentality for the knockout stages. They enjoyed the Europa League and now they have the chance to play in the biggest competition of all, so the motivation is even bigger.” #MUFC"
The boss discusses the benefits of today's #UCL training session. #MUFC pic.twitter.com/EsPeJkc1fd
"“Sevilla have good defensive organisation, they defend with everybody,” Jose says. “[Sevilla manager Vincenzo] Montella is Italian – Italian coaches know how to organise their teams very compact from the defensive point of view.”"
"“I think that tomorrow and in a few weeks at Old Trafford, the two teams are very balanced,” the boss says. “I would say the same chances for both teams, but we want to go with everything and we are confident that over two legs we can do it.” #MUFC"
"“We played against Huddersfield with the players we had available,” Jose says. “The only player who didn’t play was De Gea. But it wasn’t to save him, it was because we have lots of respect for Romero and he deserves some matches to play and to be ready for the World Cup.” #MUFC"
"Jose: “Manchester United in the Champions League is quite a big thing, we always want to play against the best teams and this is why we like this competition. So, Alexis wanted to come to a team in order to play in the Champions League [this season].” #MUFC"
"""There is a long way to go,"" Jose says. “We have to focus on the very difficult opponent [Sevilla] and the first match of this two-legged knockout tie – a match that doesn’t decide anything – but is very important.” #MUFC"

80' - Now Rooney heads over after Lingard nods the ball back into his path. Come on United! #MUFC #STOMUN

76' - Rashford chests the ball down just inside the area but his curling effort drifts wide of Lee's left-hand post. #MUFC #STOMUN

27' - Marouane Fellaini rises well to reach Mata's cross but his header is straight at Lee Grant. #MUFC #STOMUN
19' - Goal. Stoke 1 United 0.  The home side take the lead against the run of play after Pieters' cross deflects off Mata and then De Gea

90+3' - GOOOOOAAALLLL! Everton 1 United 2.   YES! pic.twitter.com/QXhdboMnhO
90'+1 - We'll have three minutes of added time at Wembley. #mufc
89' - Yellow cards. Ander Herrera and Ross Barkley both go into the book. #mufc
"87' - Substitution for United. Fellaini off, Herrera on. Good shift, Felli! #mufc pic.twitter.com/9P1rEpouAr"
82' - Fantastic stuff by Marouane Fellaini to block Lukaku's effort from close range. Heart-in-mouth stuff. #mufc
"80' - Everton go close again and it's Lukaku once more. He heads just wide, shortly after De Gea saved well from Deulofeu. #mufc"
75' - Own goal. Everton 1 United 1.  Desperately unlucky as Smalling diverts Deulofeu's cross into his own net. #mufc
"70' - Substitution for Everton. Lennon off, Deulofeu on. #mufc"
👏👏👏 pic.twitter.com/FseQE3OEYB
65' - Fellaini goes so close to adding a second! How did that stay out???  Replays show Jagielka used his hand. Nobody saw it. #mufc
63' - Lukaku heads over from close range. Everton are buliding up a head of steam... #mufc
"61' - Substitution for United. Fosu-Mensah off, Valencia on. #mufc"
60' - Yellow card. Wayne Rooney was booked a couple of minutes ago by referee Anthony Taylor. #mufc
#DaveSaves pic.twitter.com/L0OjWoxCJx
57' - #DaveSaves the penalty!!!!
56' - Penalty awarded to Everton for a Fosu-Mensah foul on Barkley. #mufc
"54' - Great move! Fosu-Mensah, Rashford, Martial and Lingard all involved before Jesse fires wide. #mufc"
46' - Everton get the second half under way. Big 45 minutes ahead! #mufc
When you score at Wembley against your former club... #mufc pic.twitter.com/gXrvZGvc5x
HT: Everton 0 United 1.   We're deservedly ahead at the break thanks to Fellaini's 34th-minute strike. #mufc pic.twitter.com/ji8OY54hph
Thoughts so far? Who's been your standout performer? #mufc
Martial did well down the left before cutting the ball back to Fellaini to slot home against his former club. #mufc pic.twitter.com/FZwJ0m6MRi
34' - GOOOOAAAALL! Everton 0 United 1.  Marouane Fellaini puts United in front! #mufc pic.twitter.com/u55SV0Y5Du
PICS: No shortage of entertainment so far at Wembley but the score remains 0-0 (25'). #mufc pic.twitter.com/SxkSELL3w6
21' - So close! Lingard threads the ball through but Martial's powerful shot flies just over the bar. #mufc
12' - Lingard meets Rooney's lofted pass on the half-volley but his effort is straight at the Everton goalkeeper. Still 0-0. #mufc
8' - Marcos Rojo flashes a header inches wide of the post from Rooney's free-kick. It's been a frantic start so far! #mufc
Rooney did fantastically to head clear after Lukaku pounced on a long clearance and rounded De Gea. #mufc
6' - Chances at both ends - Martial after a tricky run into the box and then Lukaku has a shot cleared off the line by Rooney. #mufc
@oliverjameswebb Great view. Cheer 'em on! #mufc
1' - Rashford and Rooney kick off to get the FA Cup semi-final under way! #mufc pic.twitter.com/WNDisUAEKn

FT: City 0 United 1. Rashford's goal seals a big win that breathes new life into the Reds' top-four bid. #mufc pic.twitter.com/rzZhPfGPF3
90+6' - @ChrisSmalling sticks out a perfectly-timed boot to dispossess Aguero in the box. Is that the game for United? #mufc
90+1' - We're into the first of six minutes of added time and Aguero fires a presentable chance wide after cutting inside Valencia. #mufc
88' - Rashford is limping slightly but United have made all three substitutions. Can the Reds hold on to this lead? #mufc
"83' - Substitution for United. Tim Fosu-Mensah replaces @DarmianOfficial, who is struggling with cramp. #mufc"
@MUscBh Great celebrations at #ILOVEUNITED! http://snpy.tv/1XF7rsi

70' - Substitution for United. @BSchweinsteiger comes on for @JuanMata8. #mufc

65' - Bony has been a threat since coming on but Smalling makes a superb sliding tackle to deny the City striker in front of goal. #mufc
63' - Substitution. @anto_v25 replaces @MarcosRojo5. That means @DarmianOfficial moves across to left-back. #mufc
61' - Aguero looks to find Silva with a pass but Darmian does well to clear the ball ahead of the Spaniard. Still 1-0 to #mufc.

47' - Demichelis almost sells Hart short with a weak backpass but the City keeper gets to the ball just ahead of Martial. #mufc
46' - The action resumes and there have been no changes at the break. Here's to more of the same from the Reds in the second half. #mufc
These were the scenes in Bahrain at #ILOVEUNITED when Marcus Rashford opened the scoring. http://snpy.tv/1pCMnsb

41' - Toure and Navas have fired wide in the last few minutes but United have subdued the home crowd as we approach half-time. #mufc
33' - Half an hour gone and United are good value for the 1-0 lead. The Reds' pace and movement is unsettling City's defence. #mufc

10' - Yellow card. Smalling is the first player to be booked for pulling back Aguero. #mufc
8' - City have the first half-chance of the game as Navas latches on to Darmian's headed clearance but volleys wide. #mufc
